/*Write a query that can extract the following information from the "employees" database:
- the salary values (in ascending order) of the contracts signed by all employees numbered between 10500 and 10600 inclusive
- a column showing the previous salary from the given ordered list
- a column showing the subsequent salary from the given ordered list
- a column displaying the difference between the current salary of a certain employee and their previous salary
- a column displaying the difference between the next salary of a certain employee and their current salary
Limit the output to salary values higher than $80,000 only.
Also, to obtain a meaningful result, partition the data by employee number.*/
